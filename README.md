# C Shell for Minux
A lightweight Minux-targeted shell implemented in C with support for command execution, piping, redirection, background jobs, and built-in commands.

---

## ðŸŽ® Features 

- Execute standard Unix commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, etc.)
- Input/output redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`)
- Pipelining (`|`)
- Background execution (`&`)
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `exit`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`
- Signal handling (e.g., `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Z`)
- Job control with process tracking

## ðŸ§  What We Learned
	â€¢	Low-level process management using fork, exec, wait, and kill
	â€¢	Parsing CLI input with whitespace and operators
	â€¢	Implementing background process management and job tracking
	â€¢	Handling Unix signals and writing modular C code

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
	â€¢	Implement command history with arrow key support
	â€¢	Add scripting support and configuration files
	â€¢	Improve error handling and edge case robustness
